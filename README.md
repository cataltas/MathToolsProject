# Mathematical Tools for Data Science Project (Spring 2020) 
This project was the work of Camille Taltas and Dan Turkel, under the supervision of PhD students Efe Onaran and Tim Kunisky. The goal of this project was to mathematically and numerically prove that we can recover high frequency signals from low-resolution data. More particularly we were interested in recovering point-sources or peaks in the signal, especially when sparse, given that we have multiple observations of the low-resolution signal. This problem had previously been worked on by Efe and Tim and the task we focused on was to numerically investigate which kernels worked best as interpolating polynomials for these signals. Our report can be found in Superresolution_Report.pdf and our numerical experiments in the Jupiter notebook Experiments.ipynb. The python scripts were previously written by Efe and Tim and were used to run our experiments.
